### The Business

Users will be able to view a list of 30 venues in their immediate area that MAY have a bathroom(s). These venues will appear on a Google map, as well as in the form of a list of buttons below the map. Clicking on markers in the map will open an info window that contains a link to the establishments profile page. Clicking a button in the list will open a preview modal that contains ratings for potential bathrooms at the establishment, as well as a link to the establishment profile page. 

On the establishment profile page, one has the opportunity to toggle to a form where a user can rate and comment on a bathroom at a given establishment. This information will then be collected across users and displayed on the establishment profile page.
